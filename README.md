# sp_dist-niche_modeling
This repository contains the data and scripts that I'm using in my statistical modeling and analysis in my research.
My research mainly focuses on the evolutionary ecological processes of species, from trait variation, 
niche divergences to genetic structure variation. The data stored along with the scripts here are original and first-hand;
I have used plenty of libraries of R and Python with my own to perform many statistical analysis and modeling.
Note: the content may constantly change as I frequently improve and alter my analyses.
